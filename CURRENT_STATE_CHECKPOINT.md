# Current State Checkpoint

Date: 2026-05-25
Scope: webpage-app storefront and shared public-site UI

## Current verified state

- Storefront gradients have been restored across the shared webpage theme surfaces.
- Product cards now show a fixed top-right availability badge of `200 Ready` when the item is in stock.
- Sold-out product cards still show a sold-out state and keep the disabled purchase behavior.
- The sticky navigation behavior remains in place from the previous fix by keeping vertical overflow available on the shared app shell.
- The store product detail view at `/store/product/[id]` has improved card alignment through a more balanced detail grid, clearer price-and-status grouping, and better-balanced review section panels.
- The store product route wrapper now uses explicit imports/exports so direct `/store/product/[id]` navigation resolves correctly in local dev.

## Files updated in this checkpoint

- `components/ProductBox.js`
- `pages/product/[id].js`
- `pages/store/product/[id].js`
- `styles/globals.css`

## Validation completed

- Editor error check passed for the updated files.
- Production build passed with `npm run build` in `webpage-app`.
- A live dev-server check confirmed `/store/product/6a0f10eee6859488881066b0` renders successfully after the route wrapper update.

## Notes

- This checkpoint reflects the current webpage system state after the latest storefront UX revision.
- The store-specific route file now wraps the shared product page with explicit imports/exports rather than a one-line re-export.
